A custom build of OpenCV is required. You can use the script in `opencv/` to generate such build.

A custom build of `@zxing-js/library` is included in this repo. It includes a bug fix without which the tests won't be able to complete. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/monyxie/zxing-js-library).
